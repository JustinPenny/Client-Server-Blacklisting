COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS: To compile, enter "make" in the command line, a pserver and client executable file will be created

TO EXECUTE: Client must be ran first. To run the client, enter "./pserver xxxx" into the command line, where xxxx is the
desired port number. After sever is running, enter "./client xxxx" into the command line, where xxxx is the matching port number.

IMPORTANT: The list.txt and blacklist.txt files must not be blank, the program will automatically fill in empty entries with "empty" when
that space is not in use. Both files will be submitted in this form, but this is important to remember if testing the file and you want to remove entries
from either file.
